									<h1>SQL Project<br />
									Heart Attack Data</h1>
									<p>This project was created together with my fellow students Lasse Willen and Vincent Stilz. The data set can be found under the following link: </p> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/heart-attack-dataset"> Heart Attack Data Set</a>
									<p>The SQL Code can also be found here in the folder Project_Codes: <a href="https://github.com/LeonSKozak/Portfolio.github.ie">Data Science Portfolio on GitHub</a>!</p>

								<p>In this dataset, a collection of different clinical metrics and other data can be found that aims to explain and understand cardiovascular health. It includes:
							<ul>
								<li> 
									"Age and Gender (coded as integers), fundamental demographics for risk assessment."
								</li>	
								<li> 
									"Heart Rate, Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (integers), key cardiovascular health indicators."
								</li>	
								<li> 
									"Blood Sugar levels (float), critical for diabetes management, a risk factor for heart conditions."
								</li>
								<li> 
									"CK-MB and Troponin levels (floats), biochemical markers that indicate heart muscle damage and are crucial for diagnosing myocardial injuries."
								</li>	
								<li> 
									"Result: A diagnosis outcome, "positive" or "negative," reflecting the presence or absence of a cardiovascular condition."
								</li>
							</ul>
								</p>
                                    
							<p>In SQL, various steps have been taken to analyze the data, which led to the following findings:</p>
                                    
							<p>Dataset Verification: The initial query confirmed the successful upload of the medical dataset.</p>
                                    
							<p>Diagnosis Counts: The dataset contains 810 positive and 509 negative diagnoses for heart attacks.</p>
                                    
							<p>Average Health Metrics by Diagnosis:</p>
                                    
							<p>Patients with a negative diagnosis have lower average CK-MB and troponin levels (2.55 and 0.027 respectively), compared to those with a positive diagnosis, where the averages are significantly higher (23.27 and 0.571 respectively). This suggests that elevated levels of these markers are associated with positive heart attack diagnoses and therefore might be drivers of heart attacks.
                                    Other health metrics like age, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and blood sugar levels also vary between the two groups, with positive diagnoses showing slightly higher average age and heart rate but similar blood pressure readings and lower blood sugar levels.
                                    Age Distribution: The overall patient population shows a broader age range with an average age slightly lower than that of positive diagnoses, highlighting age as a risk factor.</p>
                                    
                            <p>Gender Distribution: Males have a higher count of both positive and negative diagnoses compared to females, indicating a potential gender-related risk factor in heart attack incidence.</p>
                                    
							<p>Blood Sugar Analysis: Among patients with a positive heart attack diagnosis, blood sugar levels ranged widely, suggesting variability in glucose management among those diagnosed with heart conditions.</p>
                                    
							<p>Marker Levels: Troponin and CK-MB levels were substantially higher on average in positive heart attack diagnoses, underscoring their importance as biomarkers in heart attack detection. </p>
							<p> Our analysis showed that Troponin levels above 0.1 and CM-MB levels above 5 a significantly higher risks of receiving a heart attack diagnosis.</p>
							<p>Our SQL analysis of the data shows the significance of CK-MB and Troponin levels when understanding heart attacks. Other factors, such as age, gender or blood sugar levels play an important role too. To conclude, higher levels in CK-MB and Troponin, older age, and the male gender lead to a statistically higher risk of suffering heart attacks. </p>
