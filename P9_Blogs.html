								<p><strong>databutmakeitfashion (Instagram):</strong></p>
								<a href="https://www.instagram.com/databutmakeitfashion/"> databutmakeitfashion on Instagram</a>
    							<p>databutmakeitfashion is an instagram page run by the computer science major Madé Lapuerta, that I stumbled over during my last year at DCU. Lapuerta works as a Manager at McKinsey and founded the company Data, But Make It Fashion in 2020. The account analyzes and visualizes how trends change in fashion on a weekly basis. The analyses are mostly based on data from Google Search Requests and Sentiment Analyses. Although the instagram page does not focus on the technical background of the analyses, I believe that it shows the versatility of how data science can be used.</p>

								<p><strong>Kevin Gray on the Future of Marketing Data science (KDnuggets):</strong></p>
								<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/01/marketing-data-science-headed.html"> The Blog Post on KDnuggets.com</a>
    							<p>As mentioned, I am passionate about marketing and am aiming towards a career in this field. Therefore, this article, although not the newest, is highly interesting to me. As the author admits, he mostly focuses on threats to marketing data science, which was an interesting perspective that does not get featured often. Especially interesting to me was the critique on personalized marketing, as it would only subsidize purchases that would have been made regardless. This is a stance that is not often expressed and was therefore new and very interesting for me. Since I will be doing a internship at Procter and Gamle after my studies, a company that mainly sells their products to supermarkets, who often carry out personalised marketing in the form of brochures, this article offered me interesting insights that are worth looking into more.</p>

								<p><strong>Ann Gynn: 5 Skills All Marketing Analytics and Data Science Pros Need Today (KDnuggets):</strong></p>
								<a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2023/08/mads-5-skills-marketing-analytics-data-science-pros-need-today.html"> The Blog Post on KDnuggets.com</a>
    							<p>This is another Blog posts on KDnuggets. It explains 5 important skills for the field of Marketing Data Science. The biggest take away point from this article for me were that the fiels is constantly adapting, meaning that technologies and laws are changing on a regular basis. Furthermore, according to the author, it is important to not only focus on the technical side, but instead to understand how good story telling works with data and to not loose one's focus on the actual business goals.</p>

								<p><strong>Pritesh Patel on how AI is transforming marketing strategies in 2024 (Data Science Central):</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Using data to predict film success at the Box Office (Share Creative):</strong></p>
								<a href="https://sharecreative.com/news/using-data-to-predict-film-success-at-the-box-office/"> The Blog Post on sharecreative.com</a>
    							<p>A very interesting Article that aims to predict which features play the biggest role when it comes to box office success. I found this article after I finished my Project 2, in which I had the same goal. Therefore it was very interesting for me to compare the two analyses. While my analysis has shown that reviews and budget are the most important predictors of box office success, this article has at least shown that the budget of films has increased in recent years, and with it the box office success. Overall, this article focuses more on individual film genres. In my analysis, I found that genre and box office success are negatively correlated (-0.24).</p>

    							<p>As I was planning to include a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project in which I wanted to webscrape the sentiment data off of X myself, this was a great article that showed me, that this is not possible anymore with X. At least not if you want to keep it 100% legal.</p>
